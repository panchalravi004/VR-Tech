                  Abrasive cutting methods are used for hard materials such as
                  metal, glass, minerals, concrete, glass composites, ceramics,
                  aluminum or silicone oxide. In other words, abrasive is added
                  where pure water is unable to cut the material properly. In
                  the abrasive cutting process, abrasive (consisting of fine
                  particles) is added to the waterjet. In the cutting head,
                  water, air and abrasive are mixed together and forced through
                  the focusing tube at high speed. The resulting high-energy jet
                  is capable of micro-eroding, i.e., drilling and cutting,
                  materials of great thicknesses and of the most diverse
                  consistencies, such as metals, ceramics, rock and even
                  bullet-proof glass.

                  A special abrasive head is mounted on the water nozzle. In
                  this head, the abrasive is mixed with the pressurized water.
                  The movement of the cutting head is normally CNC controlled
                  through the waterjet cutting unit. Early detection leakage
                  points protect the orifice body, nozzle pipe and nozzle nut
                  against damage, as they indicate if connections must be
                  retightened or seals replaced. Thanks to the unique design of
                  the cutting head, seals can be replaced in less than five
                  minutes and without tools. The precision performance combined
                  with easy maintenance of KMT Waterjet abrasive cutting heads
                  offer unrivaled value. Thanks to the simple design, orifices
                  can be changed in seconds without the need for any tools.

                  This method is primarily used for soft materials such as
                  plastics, textiles, paper, sealing materials, metal foils,
                  plywood, food, etc. Normal tap water is pressurized and forced
                  through a small precious stone orifice, so that a highly
                  powerful cutting jet is produced. This jet exits the orifice
                  at a speed of up to three times that of sound and can be used
                  to cut materials at high cutting speeds (determined by the
                  properties of the material).

                  Water is fed through specially designed pressure-proof
                  flexible pipelines to the cutting head. The cutting head
                  consists of a pneumatically operated valve and a nozzle tube
                  with a precious stone orifice (normally made in sapphire or
                  diamond) at its outlet. The cutting jet exits the orifice at
                  up to three times the speed of sound.
